# hello-world
Hi fellow humans!

This is the beginning of a journey for me into a new world.

Leaving the aerospace industry after 20 plus years with the aim of learning coding and starting a new career.

I have worked all over the world and hope to do say again as a freelancer..

Also have 2 girls and a baby boy on the way!
